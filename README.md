# My First PCB

So you've been building up circuits on a breadboard for a while now, and maybe soldering some of them onto stripboard, but want to make them look nicer and be quicker and easier to solder?  You need to design your own printed circuit boards!

It's easier than you think.

Start off by running through the basics in [Designing an LED Throwie](DesigningAnLEDThrowie) and then choose your own route through the remaining tutorials based on what you're looking to build.

## Lessons

 * [Designing an LED Throwie](DesigningAnLEDThrowie).  The basics, from breadboard to ordering PCBs.  **DO THIS ONE FIRST**
 * [Adding Artwork](AddingArtwork).  Every board deserves a logo!
 * [Making Footprints](MakingFootprints) or "I want to use a part that isn't in the library!"
 * [Now Available In 3D](NowAvailableIn3D).  Making 3D models of your board (and creating 3D models for parts without them)

## Finding Out More

More coming soon

### Infinity of Traces

I found this [clip of Edward Said](https://soundcloud.com/nicolas-holzheu/edward-said-on-gramsci-infinity-of-traces-without-an-inventory) talking about Gramsci's concept of an "infinity of traces" which I'd originally heard as part of one of the Edward Said mixtapes of [The East Is A Podcast](https://www.eastpodcast.com/)


*"The starting-point of critical elaboration is the consciousness of what one really is, and is 'knowing thyself' as a product of the historical process to date which has deposited in you an infinity of traces, without leaving an inventory."*

*"L’inizio dell’elaborazione critica è la coscienza di quello che è realmente, cioè un 'conosci te stesso' come prodotto del processo storico finora svoltosi che ha lasciato in te stesso un’infinità di tracce accolte senza beneficio d’inventario."*

**Antonio Gramsci - Quaderni del carcere / The Prison Notebooks:**

I think any kind of critical approach to making needs some consideration of this idea.

Technical practices and components have hugely dense networks of such *traces*, the *work*, *care* and history packed inside them.

Who made and designed them, where and at what 'cost' were they made becomes relevant when we want to make ethically, with care and with love for the technology we use and depend on.

Things like Energy toxicity is vital in writing new histories and new traces into the stuff we make and maintain.

 Perhaps *any* previously thought of 'externality' needs to be considered in our technology's Bill Of Materials (BOM). So some kind of open source social justice audit, to *inventorize* these *traces* and costs for making, maintaining and using the  technology we love is really important.


### Show The Love: Always Be Inventorizing

Hackspace and tech culture, is often protrayed as an anarchic space of crazy disruption but my take is different. From my perspective and experience of two particular hackspaces, [DoES Liverpool](https://doesliverpool.com) and  [DasLabor](https://wiki.das-labor.org/w/LABOR_Wiki) they are more like spaces of love and care. This love manifests in many ways, and like other kinds of love it can sometimes be complicated. One way love comes out is a 'love' for auditing, accounting or verbose documentation for the community and beyond. This love for 'inventorizing' lends itself to Said's take on what Gramsci wrote in his famous prison notebooks.

In it Said pretty much describes the overall project of knowledge and meaning making, perhaps the main human goal behind it. And I think it's a useful perspective for technical culture no matter what your politics may be.

*"Not to show that my history is better than yours, my history is worse than yours, I'm the victim and you're somebody who has oppressed people and so on, but rather to understand my history in terms of other peoples history, in other words to try and understand... to move beyond, to generalize, one's own experience to the experience of others"*

*"and I think...the great.. goal is in fact to become someone else, to transform itself from a unitary identity to an identity that includes the other without supressing the difference. That he says is the great goal."*

Some experiments here with @amcewen are based on the idea that through learning how to make your first pcb we can also begin to consider how we might make a [critical Bill of Materials (BOM)](https://github.com/cheapjack/my-first-pcb) and that this might be a good habit to get into for maker culture and business-not-quite-as-usual. People like [Adrian McEwwn](https://twitter.com/amcewen) and [MCQN.com](https://mcqn.com) are passionate that hackerspace and makerspaces and ways of making technology can change the world, maybe one BOM at a time...



## MET Matrix

Map out an [energy toxicity matrix](MET_Matrix.md) so we trace the complete carbon costs of your build taken from the [Thingscon 2018 Materials Energy Toxicity Matrix](http://thingscon2018.productscience.net/) developed at OMGCLIMATE 2019. We found this via [@mrchrisadams](https://twitter.com/mrchrisadams) excellent talk on [Reducing Carbon In the Digital Realm](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_uTPiW5aMCwFhZcpLDxjY-AQMgDmHIyUEZQQ-G6XXq8/edit#slide=id.g5d9e2f62d2_0_42) at [Maintenance Festival 2019 in Liverpool](https://festivalofmaintenance.org.uk)
